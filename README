# About
Interceptor is a Growl Display that allows other Applications to receive Growl Notifications via NSDistributedNotificationCenter  
 
Basically it does two things, if a Growl notification arrives it:
1. Displays the notification using a regular display style (configurable in the settings)
2. Posts a NSNotification to the NSDistributedNotificationCenter including the notifications content encoded in JSON.  

# Usage
Here's how to receive notifications from Interceptor in another Application 
  
First, subscribe to the notification
```
/*
         Subscribe to Interceptor Notications
         */
        [[NSDistributedNotificationCenter defaultCenter]addObserver:self 
                                                           selector:@selector(mwmDidReceiveNotification:) 
                                                               name:@"InterceptorGrowlNotification" 
                                                             object:nil];
 ```
  
Then setup a method to handle Notifications. The data is encoded in JSON and formatted like this:
```{
	"src":"Growl",
	"title":"Preview","
	text":"This is a preview of the Interceptor display"
}```


Use a JSON parser to get a dictionary representation of the above.

```
-(void)mwmDidReceiveNotification:(NSNotification*)aNotification {
    NSDictionary *dict = (NSDictionary*)[parser objectWithString:[aNotification object]];
   // do something 
}
```
